Edge computing has the potential to address the concerns of response time requirement, battery life constraint, bandwidth cost saving, as well as data safety and privacy. In this paper, we introduce the definition of edge computing, followed by several case studies, ranging from cloud offloading to smart home and city, as well as collaborative edge to materialize the concept of edge computing. Finally, we present several challenges and opportunities in the field of edge computing, and hope this paper will gain attention from the community and inspire more research in this direction.},

  abstract   = {Elasticity is the ability of a cloud infrastructure to dynamically change the amount of resources allocated to a running service as load changes. We build an autonomous elasticity controller that changes the number of virtual machines allocated to a service based on both monitored load changes and predictions of future load. The cloud infrastructure is modeled as a G/G/N queue. This model is used to construct a hybrid reactive-adaptive controller that quickly reacts to sudden load changes, prevents premature release of resources, takes into account the heterogeneity of the workload, and avoids oscillations. Using simulations with Web and cluster workload traces, we show that our proposed controller lowers the number of delayed requests by a factor of 70 for the Web traces and 3 for the cluster traces when compared to a reactive controller. Our controller also decreases the average number of queued requests by a factor of 3 for both traces, and reduces oscillations by a factor of 7 for the Web traces and 3 for the cluster traces. This comes at the expense of between 20% and 30% over-provisioning, as compared to a few percent for the reactive controller.},
